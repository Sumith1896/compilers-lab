cs316 Assignment 1
-------------------

Submission deadline 17:00, Fri 20 Jan 2017. The submission will be on moodle.

You have been given 
	1. some valid and invalid input programs (Examples) for Level 1 of  
	   our subset (please see http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~uday/sclp-web),
	2. a complete grammar of Level 1(grammar.txt),
        3. x86-64 based reference implementation (sclp14 and sclp16 for Ubuntu 
           14.04 and 16.04)
	4. a skeleton scanner specification (scanner.ll), 
	5. a parser specification (parser.yy),
        6. all class declarations and header files,
	7. a reference library (separate versions for Ubuntu 14.04 and 
	   Ubuntu 16.04) that implements the classes, and
	8. associated Makefile.

You have to complete the scanner and parser specifications to create your first
compiler that accepts Level 1 of the language. The places that you need to fill
in have been marked with the following comment

	//ADD YOUR CODE HERE

You can execute the reference implementations and examine various dumps to understand
the behaviour of the compiler.
