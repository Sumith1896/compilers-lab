Our current submission directory compiles with no dependecies.
This submission was built on top of our Assignment 5 submission (including bonus which consisted SWITCH, FOR, BREAK, GOTO).

Notes:
1) We match the reference on most ocassions expect for the following two issues:
- Some semantic checks that have not been incorporated in the reference implementation
- Reference produces wrong offsets and hence incorrect spim code (refer http://moodle.iitb.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=56769)
2) We have kept in mind that for correct program the testing will be done by matching the output after running the spim code.
3) We have incorporated the semantic checks as posted by Sir (http://moodle.iitb.ac.in/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=56395)
